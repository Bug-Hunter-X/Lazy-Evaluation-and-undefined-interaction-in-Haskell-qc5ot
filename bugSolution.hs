The solution addresses the issue by providing a default value in the case where the condition is false, avoiding the use of `undefined`.

```haskell
maybeUndefined :: Bool -> Maybe Int
maybeUndefined True = Just 1
maybeUndefined False = Nothing -- Corrected: Provides a default value

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = maybeUndefined False
  print result -- This will now print "Nothing" without error
```

This revised version handles the case where the boolean input is `False` gracefully, preventing unexpected behavior resulting from `undefined`.  The use of `Nothing` explicitly communicates the absence of a value, making the code more robust and predictable.
