This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and the interaction with `undefined`. The function `maybeUndefined` attempts to return a value based on a condition, but if the condition is false and the otherwise branch is `undefined`, it may cause unexpected behavior when the result is later forced, potentially leading to runtime exceptions.

```haskell
maybeUndefined :: Bool -> Maybe Int
maybeUndefined True = Just 1
maybeUndefined False = undefined

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = maybeUndefined False
  print result
```
